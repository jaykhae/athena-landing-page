        <h3 class="h3">What is a Chargeback?</h3>
        <p class="h3-content" style="color: gray;">
            A chargeback is a dispute resolution mechanism in the world of electronic transactions. It occurs when the sender disputes a charge on their account and requests the platform to reverse the transaction.

        <h3 class="h3">Our Policy Stance on Malicious Chargeback</h3>
        <p class="h3-content" style="color: gray;">
            A "malicious chargeback" refers to a situation where a chargeback is initiated by the sender with fraudulent intent or without valid reason. In such cases, the sender intentionally disputes a legitimate transaction in order to obtain a refund or to defraud the merchant. Malicious chargebacks can have serious consequences for merchants, including financial losses, increased fees, reputational and operational damages.
        <br><br>
        <p class="h3-content" style="color: black;">By using the 'E-Fund' service on the Athena Protocol you automatically agree to our Anti-Malicious Chargeback Policy which states<br><br>
        1. Malicious Chargeback that occurs before the trade is completed will result in a termination of the trade and return of assets back to the sender.<br><br>
        2. Malicious Chargeback that occurs after the trade is completed would be considered as Fradulent which has Financial and Legal Repercussions.<br><br>
        3. Malicious Chargeback that occurs after the trade is completed would incur a debt with specified intrest on the seller.<br><br>
        4. Malicious Chargeback can result to temporary suspension on Trading E-funds.<br><br>
        5. Repeated Malicious Chargeback can result to permanent ban on Trading E-funds.<br><br>
        6. KYC information is required for users with minimum $10,000 trading volume for E-funds.<br><br></p>
