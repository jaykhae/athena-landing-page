                If there are many transactions being processed on the Bitcoin network at the same time, it can slow down the confirmation times for transactions. During times of high demand, such as when there is a surge in trading activity or when there are a lot of transactions being sent, the network can become congested, leading to delays in transaction processing.
                Transactions with higher fees are typically prioritized by miners because they receive higher rewards for including them in the next block. If you set a low transaction fee, miners may choose to prioritize transactions with higher fees, causing your transaction to be delayed.
                Make sure to use priorty fee when making Bitcoin transfers.
