        <h3 class="h3">Common Giftcard Scams</h3>
        <p class="h3-content" style="color: gray;">
            Gift card scams are unfortunately common and can take various forms. Here are some of the most common ones:<br><br>
            1. Activation Scams: Fraudsters may tamper with gift cards on store shelves, copying down the card numbers and PINs. Once a card is activated and loaded with funds, scammers quickly spend the money online before the purchaser or recipient has a chance to use it.<br><br>
            2. Phishing Scams: Scammers may contact individuals via email, phone calls, or text messages claiming to be from reputable companies or government agencies. They might ask for gift card numbers and PINs under false pretenses, such as claiming unpaid taxes or promising prizes or rewards.<br><br>
            3. Fake Sweepstakes or Contests: Scammers may lure victims by claiming they've won a prize or contest, but to claim the reward, they need to purchase gift cards and provide the card information for verification purposes. Legitimate contests or sweepstakes do not require payment to claim a prize.<br><br>
            4. Tech Support Scams: Scammers may pose as technical support agents from well-known companies and claim that there is a problem with the victim's computer or software. They may request payment via gift cards to "fix" the issue.<br><br>
            5. Impersonation Scams: Scammers may impersonate friends, family members, or authority figures, claiming to be in urgent need of financial assistance. They may ask victims to purchase gift cards to help them, exploiting the victim's trust and goodwill.<br><br>
            6. Job Opportunity Scams: Scammers may post fake job listings online, promising high-paying positions with minimal effort. As part of the "job," victims are asked to purchase gift cards and send the card information to the scammer under the guise of covering work-related expenses.<br><br>
            7. Social Media Scams: Scammers may use social media platforms to offer fake discounts, giveaways, or investment opportunities. Victims may be asked to purchase gift cards as part of the scheme.<br><br>
