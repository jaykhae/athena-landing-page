                BEP-20 is a technical standard for tokens on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), which is a blockchain platform created by Binance. BEP-20 is similar to the ERC-20 standard on the Ethereum blockchain. It defines a set of rules that token developers must follow to issue tokens on the Binance Smart Chain.

                Tokens that adhere to the BEP-20 standard are fungible and can be easily exchanged with other tokens on the Binance Smart Chain. BEP-20 tokens are commonly used for various purposes including ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings), decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and other token-based projects.
                
                Some key features of BEP-20 tokens include the ability to transfer tokens between addresses, approve spending of tokens by third-party addresses, and the ability to check the balance of tokens associated with an address.
                
                Overall, BEP-20 has become a popular standard for token creation and exchange within the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem.

                Gas fees are a critical component of the BSC chain ecosystem. When you perform any action on Binance Smart Chain, such as sending any BEP-20 token or interacting with a smart contract, you must pay a fee known as gas. Gas fees are paid in BNB BEP-20 native token and are used to compensate network participants for the computational resources required to process and validate transactions.
