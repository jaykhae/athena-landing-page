                Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, often referred to as cryptocurrency, which was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. It was introduced as open-source software in 2009.

                Bitcoin operates on a peer-to-peer network without the need for a central authority or intermediaries, making transactions directly between users. These transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public ledger called a blockchain. The supply of Bitcoin is limited to 21 million coins, which are gradually released through a process called mining. Mining involves using computer power to solve complex mathematical problems, and miners are rewarded with new bitcoins for their efforts. Bitcoin has gained significant attention and adoption over the years, both as a digital currency and as a speculative investment. Its price can be highly volatile, and it has been subject to regulatory scrutiny and market fluctuations. Nevertheless, it has become one of the most well-known cryptocurrencies and has inspired the development of numerous other digital currencies and blockchain projects.
