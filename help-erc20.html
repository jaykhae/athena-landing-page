                ERC-20 is a technical standard used for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It defines a set of rules that Ethereum-based tokens must adhere to, ensuring compatibility between different tokens and allowing them to interact seamlessly with various applications, such as wallets and exchanges.

                The term "ERC-20" stands for "Ethereum Request for Comment 20." It was proposed by Fabian Vogelsteller and Vitalik Buterin in November 2015, and the final version was accepted in September 2017. ERC-20 tokens have become the most commonly used type of token on the Ethereum platform and are utilized in countless decentralized applications (dApps), Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), and token sales.
            Key features of ERC-20 tokens include functions to transfer tokens, check the balance of tokens held by a particular address, and approve spending of tokens by another address. Additionally, ERC-20 tokens must provide specific metadata, such as the total supply of tokens, the token name, and the token symbol.
            The ERC-20 standard has played a significant role in the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem, providing a common framework for developers to create and interact with tokens, which has facilitated the development of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, gaming platforms, and other innovative projects on the Ethereum blockchain.

                Gas fees are a critical component of the Ethereum blockchain's ecosystem. When you perform any action on the Ethereum network, such as sending Ether (ETH) or interacting with a smart contract, you must pay a fee known as gas. Gas fees are paid in Ether and are used to compensate network participants for the computational resources required to process and validate transactions.
