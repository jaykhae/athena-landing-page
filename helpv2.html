                I.1. What is Cryptocurrency?
            </div>

            <div class="paragraph">Cryptocurrency refers to digital or virtual currencies that use cryptography for security and operate on decentralized networks based on blockchain technology. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, Solana and Tron are examples. They typically serve as mediums of exchange, units of account, and stores of value. Cryptocurrencies often have their own native blockchains or operate on existing blockchain networks. They are designed to function as standalone currencies and can be used for various purposes, including online transactions, investment, and remittances.
            </div>

            <div class="paragraph">A cryptocurrency wallet is a digital tool used to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any other digital assets. Unlike traditional wallets used to carry physical cash and cards, cryptocurrency wallets don't actually store the cryptocurrencies themselves. Instead, they store cryptographic keys, known as private keys, which are necessary for accessing the cryptocurrency stored on the blockchain.

            <div class="subtitle" id="i2">
                I.2. What is Blockchain?
            </div>

            <div class="paragraph">
                Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that records transactions across multiple computers in such a way that the registered transactions cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and the consensus of the network. In simpler terms, think of a blockchain as a digital ledger, or a record book, where transactions are recorded in blocks. Each block contains a list of transactions, a timestamp, and a cryptographic hash of the previous block, which links it to the previous block, hence forming a chain of blocks, hence the name "blockchain".

            <div class="paragraph">
                To avoid falling victim to gift card scams, it's essential to be cautious and skeptical of unsolicited requests for gift card payments, especially if they involve urgent or high-pressure tactics.
            </div>

            <div class="paragraph">
                Gift card scams are unfortunately common and can take various forms. Here are some of the most common ones:
            </div>
            
            <div class="text">
                1. Activation Scams: Fraudsters may tamper with gift cards on store shelves, copying down the card numbers and PINs. Once a card is activated and loaded with funds, scammers quickly spend the money online before the purchaser or recipient has a chance to use it.
            </div>

            <div class="text">
                2. Phishing Scams: Scammers may contact individuals via email, phone calls, or text messages claiming to be from reputable companies or government agencies. They might ask for gift card numbers and PINs under false pretenses, such as claiming unpaid taxes or promising prizes or rewards.
            </div>

            <div class="text">
                3. Fake Sweepstakes or Contests: Scammers may lure victims by claiming they've won a prize or contest, but to claim the reward, they need to purchase gift cards and provide the card information for verification purposes. Legitimate contests or sweepstakes do not require payment to claim a prize.
            </div>

            <div class="text">
                4. Tech Support Scams: Scammers may pose as technical support agents from well-known companies and claim that there is a problem with the victim's computer or software. They may request payment via gift cards to "fix" the issue.
            </div>

            <div class="text">
                5. Impersonation Scams: Scammers may impersonate friends, family members, or authority figures, claiming to be in urgent need of financial assistance. They may ask victims to purchase gift cards to help them, exploiting the victim's trust and goodwill.
            </div>

            <div class="text">
                6. Job Opportunity Scams: Scammers may post fake job listings online, promising high-paying positions with minimal effort. As part of the "job," victims are asked to purchase gift cards and send the card information to the scammer under the guise of covering work-related expenses.
            </div>

            <div class="text">
                Market risk refers to the potential for financial loss due to changes in the value of assets traded on the platform. This includes but is not limited to:
            </div>

            <div class="text">
                - Price Volatility: The prices of digital assets can be highly volatile, and sudden changes can result in significant financial loss.
            </div>

            <div class="text">
                - Liquidity Risk: The market for certain digital assets may lack sufficient liquidity, making it difficult to buy or sell these assets without significantly affecting their price.

            <div class="text">
                - System Failures: Technical issues, such as hardware or software failures, may disrupt services and prevent transactions from being processed.
            </div>

            <div class="text">

            <div class="text">
                - Default Risk: Counterparties in transactions may default on their obligations, leading to financial loss.

            </div>

            <div class="text">
                Given the nature of Digital Assets and their underlying technologies, there are a number of intrinsic risks, including but not limited to:
            </div>

            <div class="text">
                1. Technological Risks:
            </div>

            <div class="text">
                - Faults and Defects: Faults, defects, hacks, exploits, errors, protocol failures, or unforeseen circumstances can occur in respect of a Digital Asset or the technologies or economic systems on which the Digital Asset relies.
            </div>

            <div class="text">
                - Obsolescence: Technological developments may render certain Digital Assets obsolete.
            </div>

            <div class="text">
                2. Irreversibility:
            </div>

            <div class="text">
                - Transaction Finality: Transactions in Digital Assets are irreversible. Consequently, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable.
            </div>

            <div class="text">
                3. Network Issues:
            </div>

            <div class="text">
                - Delays: Network delays may cause transactions to not be settled on the scheduled delivery date.
            </div>

            <div class="text">
                - Protocol Attacks: Digital Assets may be subject to attacks on the protocol or technologies on which they depend.
            </div>

            <div class="text">
                4. Forks:
            </div>

            <div class="text">
                - Hard Forks: A hard fork may occur if developers suggest changes to a Digital Asset software and the updated software is not compatible with the original software. This can result in two versions of the Digital Asset network running in parallel, potentially impacting the demand and price of the Digital Asset.
            </div>

            <div class="text">
                5. Concentration Risk:
            </div>

            <div class="text">
                - Significant Holders: Certain addresses on blockchain networks hold a significant amount of the currently outstanding asset. If these addresses were to exit their positions, it could result in volatility affecting the asset’s price.
            </div>

            <div class="text">
                6. Majority Control Attacks:
            </div>

            <div class="text">
                - 51% Attacks: If anyone gains control of over 51% of the computing power (hash rate) of a blockchain network, they could double spend their Digital Assets. While the risk is remote for widely adopted networks, a successful attack would significantly erode trust and decrease the value of Digital Assets.
            </div>

            <div class="text">
                7. Fraud and Cyber Attacks:
            </div>

            <div class="text">
                - Risk of Fraud: Digital Assets are subject to the risk of fraud or cyber attacks.
            </div>

            <div class="text">
                8. Emerging Risks:
            </div>

            <div class="text">
                - New Asset Risks: New risks may arise from investing in new types of Digital Assets or market participants’ engagement in complex transaction strategies. The Digital Asset market is subject to speculative interest, rapid price swings, and uncertainty.
